# 🚀 50 Days Coding Challenge – LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the **50 Days Coding Challenge**, a structured daily problem-solving initiative launched by **VIT Bhopal** in collaboration with **FACE Prep**, our training partner.

## 🧠 About the Challenge

This challenge is part of the #DrGViswanathan initiative and runs from **April 30, 2025** to **June 18, 2025** (50 consecutive days).

The goal:  
To build problem-solving consistency, reinforce core DSA and programming fundamentals, and prepare effectively for both product and service-based company placements.

### 💡 Why this?
- A **day-by-day guided plan** designed for **beginners** to gradually level up.
- Problem complexity **increases every day**, helping participants grow at a steady pace.
- **You're not alone** – 100s of students are solving these challenges daily.
- Daily **video solutions** are shared, keeping learning self-paced yet structured.
- This is **purely voluntary** – but may lead to **exclusive placement opportunities**.

> More than anything, this is a chance to make your parents proud this Mother's and Father's Day — by dedicating your time and consistency to something meaningful.

  🔹 1 from *Data Structures*  
  🔹 1 from *Programming Fundamentals*

- ⏱️ **Solve within 24 hours**
- 📹 **Video solutions** + **Next day’s questions** shared daily
